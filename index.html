		<h2> Project overview </h2>
		<p>The project I am proposing is an interactive digital archive of the QR code stickers in Wellington city. Many groups/individuals scatter QR codes around the city which connects the physical 3D space to the network of the internet. <br> <br>
			However, these QR codes are not permanent. Many of them are on posters which are changed frequently, or sticker grafitti which is removed by the council or the weather.
			<br> <br>I am proposing a website with a digital map of the city (like google maps) which you can explore and find QR codes that are/were once in the city. They will be on the map where they were found in the city.<br><br>Users will be able
		to scan their codes with their phone, or simply click on a hyperlinked URL to take them to the website the original QR code lead to. </p>
		<h2> Target audience </h2>
		<p>The target audience of this website are most likely people living in Wellington city, as they will be the most interestd in what websites the codes lead to.
			<br><br>More specifically, it will be those who wander around the city and actually encounter these codes on a day to day baisis (students, people who walk to work), and people who browse
 the internet	a lot who will be the most interested in this site.
			<br><br>Tourists and pepole from around New Zealand may also be interested in exploring the QR codes of Wellington. </p>
			<h2>Physical research</h2>
			<p> When walking around the city, I see many QR codes on posters and stickers that lead to a vast variety of web pages, but I know that none of these are permanent. <br><br>I began thinking of a way to preserve these codes in a
				way that is still expolrable and accessible by the public.<br><br>Here is a selection of the codes I encountered on my way to and from university</p>
