			<h1>What do we do?</h1>
			<p>Many groups and individuals scatter Qr codes across the city, which connects the physical world to the networking of the internet in a unique way. However, these
				codes are often not permanent, as they get removed by the council or the weather.<br><br>
				Q-ARCHIVE is set up to preserve the physical network of QR codes on a desktop website, for you to explore. </p>
				<h1>How you can help</h1>
				<p>If you encounter a QR code in Wellington that has not been archived on Q-ARCHIVE we welcome you to share it with us. Go to our 'Submit a Sighting' page
					and upload a high quality photo of the code along with some basic information about it, and we will add it to the map for you. <br><br>
					This will help us increase our database of codes and provide a more accurate map of the network.
